# Colored Names

## Description

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmallJoker/colored_names/master/screenshot.png)

This client mod colorizes the nicknames in-game, so communicating gets easier, even when many people are chatting with each other. On some servers with special chat mods, this mod will stay inactive until it detects a raw/unmodified chat line.
